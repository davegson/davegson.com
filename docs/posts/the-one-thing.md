# Focus on ONE Thing to Make Your Life Easier

Last year I browsed the library of one of my best friends and stumbled across a book which changed my life. Its core idea is nothing out of the ordinary, but rather really simple. Yet this simplicity is what makes me ponder over it time and time again, actually leading me to take specific action for the better.

In a nutshell, the book tells you to ask yourself this core question in order to know what to focus on next:

> **What's the ONE thing I can do, such that by doing it everything else will be EASIER or UNNECESSARY**

That's it. ONE thing, and ONE thing only. And it has to make everything else easier or unnecessary. If you do this over and over, the expected friction within your life will decrease and your productivity will increase.

Looking back, these are things I tackled in my life in order to make everything else easier or unnecessary:

- set up a server to organise my personal todos & projects
- purchased a NAS for digital structure and cleanliness
- learned server administration in order to easily maintain these services
- moved to the country side (fits us better in many ways)
- learned to use AI tools to speed up my coding

Big and small, tackling things in order to make other things easier or unnecessary was a new perspective to me and its compound results is actually something I am super exicted about.
