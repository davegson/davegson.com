# Builder. Adventurer. Philosopher.

I'm David Gunnarsson. Together with my wife I live in Vienna, Austria. Growing up in a home that always had a computer, I was into gaming from my earliest childhood. Even though I was fascinated by math and tech, I still was a late bloomer coding wise: only in my final school years I had the means to dive into the captivating world of coding and web development.

Growing up and living with multiple languages and cultures, I am deeply fascinated by different ways of life. I firmly believe Earth's beauty lies in its diversity.

I also love philosophy and theology. As a young adult I decided to follow Jesus and was baptized. Since then, I have become more and more intrigued by the variety of Christian denominations and their shared core beliefs.

And lastly, I'm super into simplicity and communication. Finding the main idea within a product or a message - and finding the best way to convey it (ethically), is a remarkable skillset. Next to developing cool stuff, this is the area I am focusing my working hours on.

My blog covers the full range of my interests. I currently publish posts every two weeks. I write as a note to self and hope you will get value out of it too.
